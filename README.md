# pyExifChanger
Change EXIF dates in JPG files

Quick and dirty script to change the creation date / date taken timestamp in JPEG files.

Reads all JPEG files from a `img_path` and puts a copy of those files with changed EXIF data into the `output_path`.

```bash
usage: exif_date_changer.py [-h] img_path output_path

exif_date_changer.py: error: the following arguments are required: img_path, output_path
```
